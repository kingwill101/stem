The SQLite driver SHALL use ormed for schema definition and migrations, including ormed-managed migration history.

#### Scenario: SQLite initialization
- **WHEN** a new SQLite database is initialized by the driver
- **THEN** ormed migrations are applied to create the required tables and indices

### Requirement: SQLite migration bootstrap via ormed CLI
The SQLite driver SHALL provide ormed initialization assets generated by `ormed_cli:ormed init` so migrations can be applied consistently across environments.

#### Scenario: Fresh clone setup
- **WHEN** a developer bootstraps the SQLite driver package
- **THEN** ormed initialization assets are present and usable for migration setup
