### Contract Test Suite

`stem_sqlite` consumes the shared adapter test harness in
`packages/stem_adapter_tests`. Add the harness as a `dev_dependency` and run
`dart test` to execute `runBrokerContractTests` and `runResultBackendContractTests`
against the SQLite adapters. See `test/broker/sqlite_broker_test.dart` and
`test/backend/sqlite_result_backend_test.dart` for reference wiring.
