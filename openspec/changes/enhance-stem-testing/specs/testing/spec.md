## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Test Strategy & Quality Gates
Stem MUST provide test coverage across chaos, performance, and soak scenarios with clear quality gates.
#### Scenario: Chaos test covers worker failure
- **GIVEN** the test suite is executed with chaos tests enabled
- **WHEN** a worker terminates mid-task
- **THEN** the system MUST reprocess the task and verify at-least-once behaviour via automated tests

#### Scenario: Performance throughput threshold
- **GIVEN** the performance test runs under default settings
- **WHEN** the suite enqueues a burst of tasks
- **THEN** the measured throughput MUST meet or exceed the documented threshold (failing the test otherwise)

#### Scenario: Quality checks script
- **GIVEN** contributors run the quality checks script
- **WHEN** the script completes
- **THEN** it MUST run formatting, linting, tests, and produce coverage output highlighting whether the target threshold is met
