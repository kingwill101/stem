## Summary
- Implement the testing and quality gates outlined in Phase 5: chaos/performance/soak coverage, coverage targets, and deterministic CI scripts.
- Provide runnable tooling and documentation so the quality gates can be executed locally and in automation.

## Motivation
- Current test suite covers functional scenarios but lacks chaos/performance coverage, and there is no automated quality gate (coverage target, scripts) matching the plan.
- Without these gates we risk regressions under failure or load, and onboarding teams lack guidance for running the full quality suite.

## Goals
- Add automated tests or scripts for chaos (worker failure), performance (throughput), and soak (long-running smoke) scenarios.
- Introduce a coverage script with a documented target (â‰¥80%) and quality check wrapper.
- Document how to run the quality suite (README/process docs) and integrate with CI entrypoint scripts.

## Non-Goals
- Setting up remote performance infrastructure or external dashboards (scripts run locally).
- Implementing full load testing on real Redis (defaults use in-memory/embedded loops with optional Redis toggle).

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Long-running tests**: Keep soak tests behind optional flag (`--tags soak`) so default CI remains fast.
- **Flaky chaos tests**: Use deterministic in-memory broker and explicit synchronization to avoid timing flakiness.
- **Coverage overhead**: Provide a script but allow CI to opt-in gradually.

## Open Questions
- Should soak tests run in CI nightly or remain manual? (Default to manual with documentation.)
- Do we need a performance baseline metric in docs? (Provide initial threshold in tests, tune later.)
