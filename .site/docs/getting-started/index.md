This track is the recommended path for anyone new to Stem. Follow the pages in
order—each builds on the previous one and links to deeper references when you
want to explore further.

- **[Introduction](./intro.md)** – Prerequisites, the feature tour, and how the onboarding journey is structured.
- **[Quick Start](./quick-start.md)** – Create your first Stem tasks, enqueue with delays/priorities, and inspect results in memory.
- **[First Steps](./first-steps.md)** – Run a worker against Redis, enqueue from a producer, and read results.
- **[Connect to Infrastructure](./developer-environment.md)** – Run Redis/Postgres locally, configure brokers/backends, experiment with routing and canvas patterns.
- **[Observe & Operate](./observability-and-ops.md)** – Enable OpenTelemetry export, inspect workers/queues/DLQ via CLI, and wire lifecycle signals.
- **[Prepare for Production](./production-checklist.md)** – Apply signing/TLS, deploy with systemd or CLI multi-process tooling, and run quality gates before launch.
- **[Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md)** – Common errors and quick fixes while onboarding.

Once you complete the journey, continue with the in-depth material under
[Core Concepts](../core-concepts/index.md) and [Workers](../workers/index.md).
