Stem Beat coordinates periodic work across your cluster. Explore the scheduler
capabilities, storage backends, and operational tooling.

- **[Beat Scheduler Guide](./beat-guide.md)** – Configure Beat, load schedules, and run it with in-memory, Redis, or Postgres stores.
- **Example:** `example/scheduler_observability` shows drift metrics, schedule signals, and CLI inspection.

Looking for locking and storage details? See the Postgres and Redis sections in
[Broker Overview](../brokers/overview.md).
