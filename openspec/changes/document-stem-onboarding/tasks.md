## Implementation
- [x] Inventory current `.site/docs/getting-started` content and note gaps/mismatches with the desired onboarding story.
- [x] Draft a newcomer journey guide covering prerequisites → local quick start → connecting to Redis/Postgres → observability → deployment checklist under `.site/docs/getting-started/`, and ensure each major Stem feature area (core pipeline, worker operations & signals, observability/tooling, security & deployment, enablement & quality) is introduced with runnable examples.
- [x] Refresh existing getting-started pages (intro, quick start, developer environment) to align with the journey and remove conflicting guidance.
- [x] Update navigation metadata/sidebars so the onboarding flow appears in order and links to follow-up sections.
- [x] Run `npm install` (if dependencies changed) and `npm run build` inside `.site/` to confirm documentation builds cleanly; capture any follow-up fixes.
