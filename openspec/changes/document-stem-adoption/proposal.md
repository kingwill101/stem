## Summary
- Produce developer-facing documentation and samples that explain how to integrate Stem into Dart applications and scale workers horizontally.
- Capture operational guidance for sizing isolate pools, deploying workers/beat, and monitoring production clusters.

## Motivation
- Without opinionated docs, adopters struggle to embed Stem into existing services or reason about scaling patterns.
- Release readiness requires more than API references; we need concrete guides and runnable examples.

## Goals
- Author a developer guide that walks through bootstrapping Stem in a Dart service (enqueue, worker, beat, observability).
- Publish scaling and operations handbooks covering deployment topologies, isolate pool sizing, Redis tuning, and HA strategies.
- Provide runnable example apps (monolithic + microservice) demonstrating integration and configuration.

## Non-Goals
- Building marketing materials or full tutorials for non-Dart ecosystems.
- Automating infrastructure provisioning (document manual steps and example Terraform snippets only if necessary).

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Docs drift**: Introduce examples that are part of CI tests to ensure they stay updated.
- **Over-scoping**: Limit initial examples to two archetypes (monolith + microservice) and provide clear TODOs for future expansions.

## Open Questions
- Should we host docs in a separate site or the repo README? (Initial plan: keep under `/docs` with mkdocs or dartdoc integration.)
- How much guidance on Redis/Postgres deployment should be included? (Aim for pragmatic baseline with references to vendor docs.)
