## Summary
- Formalise the remaining planning and governance work (design sign-off, spikes, backlog, release/ops gates).
- Produce the artifacts required across the outstanding phases before future implementation/ops work proceeds.

## Motivation
- Current implementation meets much of the MVP scope, but documentation for design decisions, spikes, milestones, security posture, and SLO dashboards is missing.
- Without these artifacts, onboarding, audits, and future planning phases lack a source of truth.

## Goals
- Deliver the missing phase artifacts: design doc v1, ADRs, spike summaries, milestone plan, SLO/dashboard definitions, security checklist, and roadmap.
- Freeze public interfaces with version annotations to communicate the MVP contract.

## Non-Goals
- Re-implement runtime features already complete (metrics, tracing, docs, samples).
- Build new functionality beyond producing the planning/governance deliverables.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Scope creep**: Constrain tasks to documentation/governance outputs; any new runtime work requires separate changes.
- **Stale information**: establish owners for each artifact and note update cadence in the tasks.
- **Ambiguous acceptance**: track sign-off checkpoints (design review, spike findings) explicitly in tasks and spec scenarios.

## Open Questions
- Which stakeholders sign the design doc and ADRs? (TBD in tasks.)
- Do we adopt a particular docs repo or service for spike reports (e.g., Notion vs. markdown in-repo)?
