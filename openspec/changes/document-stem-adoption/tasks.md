## 1. Planning
- [x] 1.1 Outline documentation structure (developer guide, ops guide, scaling playbook) in `design.md`.

## 2. Content & Samples
- [x] 2.1 Create `/docs/developer-guide.md` covering setup, enqueueing, worker, beat, observability.
- [x] 2.2 Author `/docs/operations-guide.md` with scaling, deployment, HA considerations.
- [x] 2.3 Write `/docs/scaling-playbook.md` focusing on isolate sizing, horizontal scaling, Redis/Postgres tuning.
- [x] 2.4 Add runnable example projects (monolith + microservice) with scripts to run worker/beat locally.
- [x] 2.5 Integrate docs/examples into CI verification (lint + smoke tests).

## 3. Review
