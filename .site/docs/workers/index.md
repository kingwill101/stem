Workers pull tasks, manage concurrency, and publish lifecycle signals. Use these
guides to embed workers programmatically and operate them in production.

- **[Programmatic Integration](./programmatic-integration.md)** – Wire producers
  and workers inside your Dart services (includes in-memory and Redis examples).
- **[Worker Control CLI](./worker-control.md)** – Inspect, revoke, and shut down
  workers remotely.
- **[Daemonization Guide](./daemonization.md)** – Run workers under systemd,
  launchd, or custom supervisors.

Looking for retry tuning or task registries? See the
[Core Concepts](../core-concepts/index.md).
