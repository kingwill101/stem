# Changelog

## 0.2.0

- Narrowed the public task and workflow invocation APIs around direct
  `enqueue(...)` / `enqueueAndWait(...)` and `start(...)` / `startAndWait(...)`
  calls, with explicit transport objects left as the advanced low-level path.
- Removed duplicate transport helpers and wrapper builder entrypoints such as
  `.call(...)`, `prepareStart(...)`, `prepareEnqueue(...)`, builder dispatch
  methods, and `copyWith(...)` on transport objects.
- Added shared execution-context interfaces for workflows and tasks so manual
  handlers and checkpoints can use one typed context surface instead of several
  partially overlapping ones.
- Added expression-style suspension and event APIs for workflows, plus direct
  typed event emit/wait helpers on workflow event refs.
- Added module-first bootstrap improvements including module merge/combine,
  inferred worker subscriptions, queue/subscription inspection helpers, and
  shared app/client workflow bootstrap helpers.
- Expanded manual serialization support with `json(...)`, `versionedJson(...)`,
  `versionedMap(...)`, registry-backed versioned factories, and codec-backed
  low-level publish/start/emit helpers for tasks, workflows, and queue events.
- Added broad typed decode helpers across runtime, inspection, signal, queue,
  status, and context surfaces so DTO reads no longer require raw map casts in
  the common path.
- Refreshed examples and docs to use the narrowed happy-path APIs and to treat
  transport objects as explicit advanced APIs rather than peer entrypoints.

## 0.1.0

- Added workflow run leasing APIs (`claimRun`, `renewRunLease`, `releaseRun`,
  `listRunnableRuns`) and runtime ownership tracking to safely spread workflows
  across workers.
- Added TaskRetryPolicy and TaskEnqueueOptions for per-enqueue overrides
  (timing, retries, callbacks), plus TaskContext/TaskInvocationContext enqueue,
  spawn, and retry helpers including isolate entrypoint support and a fluent
  TaskEnqueueBuilder.
- Added inline FunctionTaskHandler execution (runInIsolate toggle) to simplify
  choosing between inline vs. isolate task execution.
- Added workflow/task annotations and a registry builder to streamline
  declarative workflow setup with existing Flow/WorkflowScript APIs.
- Added StemClient as a single entrypoint for configuring workers and workflow
  apps with shared broker/backend registries.
- Added TaskContext demos and refreshed docs/snippets for enqueue options and
  SQLite guidance.
- Added typed workflow, task, and canvas result APIs with customizable encoders
  (TaskResultEncoder and payload encoders).
- Added new example suites (progress heartbeat, worker control lab, and the
  feature-complete set) plus refreshed docs/Taskfiles for running them.
- Added signals registry/configuration for worker, task, scheduler, and
  workflow lifecycle events.
- Improved worker runtime (isolate pool, config, heartbeats/autoscaling) plus
  scheduler behavior (timezone alias handling, in-memory schedule store).
- Exposed lock ownership in interfaces and migrated IDs to UUID v7.
- Removed sqlite migrations from core and updated dependencies (collection,
  contextual, crypto, cryptography, timezone, uuid).
- Expanded internal docs and example suites, plus broader unit/property and
  workflow store contract coverage.

## 0.1.0-alpha.4

- Introduced **Durable Workflows** end-to-end: auto-versioned steps, iteration-
  aware contexts, and durable event watchers so long-running flows replay safely
  and resume with persisted payloads.
- Added a `WorkflowClock` abstraction (with `FakeWorkflowClock`) so runtimes and
  stores can record deterministic timestamps during testing.
- Refined sleep/await behaviour: persisted wake timestamps now prevent
  re-suspending once a delay has elapsed, and `saveStep` refreshes run heartbeats
  so active workers retain ownership.
- Updated all workflow stores to consume injected clock metadata, ensuring
  suspension payloads include `resumeAt`/`deadline` values without relying on
  `DateTime.now()`.
- Wired `TaskOptions.unique` into the runtime via the new
  `UniqueTaskCoordinator`, allowing clusters to deduplicate submissions using
  shared `LockStore`s and surface duplicate metadata when a clash occurs.
- Workers now coordinate chord callbacks through `ResultBackend.claimChord`,
  persisting callback ids and dispatch timestamps so fan-in callbacks run exactly
  once even after crashes or retry storms.

## 0.1.0-alpha.3

- Split Redis/Postgres adapters and CLI into dedicated packages (`stem_redis`,
  `stem_postgres`, `stem_cli`) so the core package only exposes platform-agnostic
  runtime APIs.
- Updated examples, docs, and integration guides to reference the new packages.

## 0.1.0-alpha.2

- Replace the legacy `opentelemetry` dependency with `dartastic_opentelemetry` and update tracing/metrics integrations.
- Add `_init_test_env` helper to start dockerised dependencies and export integration env vars.
- Refresh project docs to mention the new telemetry stack and test environment workflow.
- Bump direct dependencies (dartastic_opentelemetry 0.9.2, postgres 3.5.9, timezone 0.10.1) and align transitive packages.

## 0.1.0-alpha

- Initial version.
